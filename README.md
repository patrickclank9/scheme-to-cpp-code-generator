# scheme-to-cpp-code-genorator
A group project from my Programming Languages course that takes in a text file with scheme code, and converts it into c++ code. The project was split into 3 parts, the lexical analyzer, the syntactical analyzer, and finally the code genorator. This is the final version using all 3.
